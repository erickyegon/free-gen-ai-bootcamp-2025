# Language Learning GenAI Platform - Functional Requirements

## System Overview
The Language Learning GenAI Platform is designed to facilitate language acquisition through AI-powered study activities and interactive learning experiences. The system leverages a core vocabulary database, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and large language models to provide personalized language learning activities.

## Core Functional Requirements

### 1. Language Portal & Word Group Management
- System must maintain a database of core 2000 vocabulary words
- Users must be able to access the Language Portal to view available word groups
- System must organize vocabulary into logical word groups for structured learning
- Teachers must be able to manage and customize word groups for their students

### 2. Study Activities Engine
- System must support multiple study activity types:
  - Sentence Constructor exercises
  - Writing practice applications
  - Light Visual Novel Reading experiences
  - Text Adventure Immersion Games
  - Visual Flashcard Vocabulary practice
  - Speech-to-Listen exercises

### 3. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Capabilities
- System must implement RAG to enhance language generation quality
- RAG component must be able to query the Vector Database to retrieve relevant language examples
- RAG must connect to external internet resources when additional context is needed
- System must maintain a Prompt Cache to optimize performance of common queries

### 4. LLM Integration
- System must integrate with a 7B parameter LLM for language processing
- Input Guardrail must validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Output Guardrail must ensure all LLM responses are appropriate, accurate, and educational

### 5. User Interaction Flow
- System must accept natural language queries from users
- Queries must be processed through the RAG system to enhance context
- System must deliver coherent, educational responses to user queries
- All user-system interactions must be tracked for personalized learning

### 6. Database Requirements
- Core 2000 words database must be maintained and regularly updated
- Vector Database must store embeddings for efficient semantic search
- System must implement efficient database querying for real-time interactions

### 7. Internet Connectivity
- System must be able to access internet resources when needed
- Connection to external resources must be secure and privacy-compliant
- System must gracefully handle offline scenarios with cached resources

### 8. Multi-user Support
- System must support both student and teacher user roles
- Teachers must have additional capabilities for content management
- Student progress must be tracked individually across all study activities

### 9. System Performance
- Study activity response time must not exceed 2 seconds
- System must handle concurrent users without performance degradation
- RAG query processing must be optimized for educational real-time interactions

## Implementation Priorities
1. Core database and word group management
2. RAG implementation with vector database integration
3. Basic study activities (Sentence Constructor, Flashcards)
4. LLM integration with guardrails
5. Advanced study activities (Visual Novel, Text Adventure)
6. Teacher management features
7. Performance optimization and scaling

## Technical Dependencies
- Vector database technology
- 7B parameter language model
- Secure internet access
- User authentication system
- Educational content management system
